# AI Tools & Platforms

Hands-on reviews, guides, and tips for AI tools I actually use.

## Topics

- **Claude** — Anthropic's assistant (API, Claude Code, Projects, Artifacts)
- **ChatGPT** — OpenAI's assistant (GPTs, plugins, Canvas)
- **Cursor** — AI-native code editor (tab completion, chat, composer)
- **GitHub Copilot** — AI pair programmer (inline, chat, workspace)
- **Midjourney / DALL-E / Flux** — Image generation
- **n8n** — Workflow automation with AI nodes

## Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing any AI tool, I assess:

1. **Capability** — what can it actually do well?
2. **Reliability** — how consistent are the results?
3. **Speed** — latency for interactive use
4. **Cost** — pricing model, free tier limits
5. **Integration** — APIs, plugins, ecosystem
6. **Data Privacy** — where does my data go?
