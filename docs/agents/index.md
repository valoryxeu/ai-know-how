# AI Agents & Automation

Building AI systems that take actions, use tools, and work autonomously.

## Topics

- **Agent Frameworks** — LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude Agent SDK
- **MCP Protocol** — Model Context Protocol for tool integration
- **n8n Workflows** — visual workflow automation with AI nodes
- **Tool Use** — function calling, structured outputs, tool chaining
- **Memory** — conversation history, long-term memory, RAG for agents
- **Planning** — ReAct, chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought, reflection
- **Multi-Agent** — orchestration, delegation, communication patterns

## Key Insight

> The best agents are not the smartest — they're the ones with the **best tools** and **clearest instructions**.
> A mediocre model with great tools beats a great model with no tools.
