# AI for Software Development

Using AI to write, review, test, debug, and ship code faster.

## Topics

- **Copilot Patterns** — effective ways to use AI code completion
- **AI Code Review** — using LLMs to catch bugs and improve code
- **Testing with AI** — generating tests, property-based testing, fuzzing
- **Debugging** — AI-assisted root cause analysis and fix suggestions
- **Documentation** — auto-generating docs, README, API references
- **Refactoring** — safe large-scale code changes with AI assistance
- **Architecture** — using AI for system design and decision-making

## Best Practices

1. **AI writes, you review** — never blindly accept generated code
2. **Small context, better output** — feed relevant code, not the whole repo
3. **Iterate, don't regenerate** — refine outputs instead of starting over
4. **Test the output** — AI-generated code needs the same testing rigor
5. **Learn from it** — use AI suggestions as a learning opportunity
