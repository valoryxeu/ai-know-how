# AI Fundamentals

Core concepts in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The foundations everything else builds on.

## Topics

- **Neural Networks** — perceptrons, layers, activation functions, backpropagation
- **Transformers** — the architecture behind modern AI (attention is all you need)
- **Attention Mechanisms** — self-attention, multi-head attention, cross-attention
- **Training** — loss functions, optimizers, regularization, overfitting
- **Embeddings** — vector representations of text, images, concepts
- **Tokenization** — how text becomes numbers (BPE, SentencePiece, tiktoken)

## Key Insight

> Modern AI is essentially: **data → embeddings → attention → prediction**.
> Understanding this pipeline explains 90% of what you see in production AI systems.
